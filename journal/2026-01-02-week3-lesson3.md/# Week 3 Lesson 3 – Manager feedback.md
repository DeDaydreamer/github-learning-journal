# Week 3 Lesson 3 – Manager feedback on PRs

## What I did
- Reviewed my draft PR #1 as if I were a COO/manager.
- Wrote example summary/question/decision comments.
- Added a PR feedback template to ROADMAP.md.

## What I learned (manager view)
- Good PR feedback is about clarity, scope, and risk, not code details.
- Having a simple template helps make reviews consistent and faster.

## Questions for Aleks
- Are there any additional sections you’d like managers to comment on (e.g. rollout, monitoring, customer impact)?
