# Week 3 Lesson 2 – PR as decision brief

## What I did
- Reviewed draft PR #1 for my README manager note.
- Checked its title, Context/Changes/Risk sections.
- Added a PR review checklist to ROADMAP.md.

## What I learned (manager view)
- A PR is a structured decision brief: it should explain why, what, and risk clearly enough for a manager to approve.
- Even low-risk doc changes should follow the same communication pattern to build good habits.

## Questions for Aleks
- Are there any extra sections (e.g. rollout plan, monitoring) we should add for higher-risk PRs?
