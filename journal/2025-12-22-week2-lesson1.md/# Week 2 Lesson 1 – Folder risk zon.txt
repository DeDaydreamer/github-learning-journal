# Week 2 Lesson 1 – Folder risk zones

## What I did
- Explored `functions/` and content folders in Electrum1210/thedaydreamverse-site
- Updated repo map with high/medium/low risk labels

## What I learned (manager view)
- `functions/` = highest risk: where the app *does things*
- Content folders = lower risk: mostly writing/editing
- Config files signal *how it runs*, not *what it does*

## Questions for Aleks
- What's the deployment process for changes in `functions/`?
- Are content changes (`posts/`) reviewed before publishing?
