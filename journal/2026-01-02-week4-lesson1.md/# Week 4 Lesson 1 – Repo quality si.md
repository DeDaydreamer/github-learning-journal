# Week 4 Lesson 1 – Repo quality signals

## What I did
- Scanned thedaydreamverse-site on GitHub for quality signals (README, issues, PRs, releases).
- Added a repo quality checklist to ROADMAP.md with initial notes.

## What I learned (manager view)
- Many repo health signals are visible without reading any code.
- README, issues/PRs, and releases together tell a story of maturity and discipline.

## Questions for Aleks
- Do we plan to use issues/PRs more heavily as it evolves?
